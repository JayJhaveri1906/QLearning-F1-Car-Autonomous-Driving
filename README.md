# Q-Learning based Autonomous Car Game

### Milestones:

1. Make track (done)
2. Make Car class (done)
3. Make Human playable Car (done)
4. Add Collision Detection (done)
5. Add Radar/Lidar based distance metric (done)
6. Add Reward Gates (done)
7. Make Reward Gates Sequential (done)
8. Add Ai controlled Car object (done)
9. Add Q-Learning on the AI (done... poor results as of now)
	1. Tune hyperparameters (done... didn't work)
	2. Replace randomized learning with humanized learning (learn by seeing what a human will do in that situation) (under works)
	3. DO MORE...
10. Add Deep Q-Learning
